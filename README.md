# **Jon's Python Course File Dump**
**aka Student Workfiles**

for my NOTES, Experiments, Course Essay Answers and Programming Drills

The contents of this repository are the files I created in December of 2016 while attending the Python Course at [The Tech Academy][b6d6f2c6]. I studied both versions so some of the code is for Python 2.7 and the more advanced stuff was written for Python 3.5. All the GUI scripts use the TKinter modules.
